#sample-code

This repository is forked from <https://github.com/appium/sample-code.git>

Since the origin repository's exmaple for python can not be run directly with Appium(1.3.7)&Appium-Python-Client(0.14)&selenium(2.42.1), I adjust some of them to adpate to these versions.

Files being adjusted:  
*sample-code/examples/python/ios_simple.py*
*sample-code/examples/python/ios_complex.py*

...  
To be continued...
